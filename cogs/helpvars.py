HELP_DESCRIPTION='Welcome to Plotter, the bot that makes graph creation easy on discord!\n\n' \
    'How to start using Plotter:\n\n' \
    '**Step 1: Creating a dataset**\n\n'\
    'Datasets are how you will store your numbers, titles, colors, and more that will fill in your graphs. You can add or remove rows of data, and Plotter will have your data available for you at all times.\n\n' \
    'To see dataset commands, type `/help datasets`!\n\n' \
    '**Step 2: Customizing your graph!** \n\n' \
    'Plotter\'s customization will allow your graphs to stand out and truly tell a story. Customizations are part of your dataset, so your settings will carry over in your graphs until changed.\n\n' \
    'To see customization options, type `/help customization`!\n\n' \
    '**Step 3: Plotting your graph!** \n\n' \
    'This is the magic step: Finally seeing your graph in action! Plotter has many different types of graphs to choose from, and all you have to do is select rows from your dataset. Plotter will also provide useful information if something about your setup isn\'t quite right.\n\n' \
    'For all the plotting options, type `/help plotting`!\n\n' \
    'To see examples of different graphs you can make with plotter (along with the commands used to generate each graph), type `/examples`!'
